# Welcome to MY project

## Project info
VoteVault Chain is a complete blockchain-based voting system that simulates Ethereum smart contract interactions.

What it is:
A secure online voting platform where elections are stored immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and preventing fraud.

Key Features:
Admin Panel: Create elections, add candidates, manage voting periods
Voter Interface: Register wallet, cast one vote per election, view live results
Results Dashboard: Real-time vote counts, election statistics, winner determination
Wallet Integration: MetaMask-style connection with mock blockchain simulation
How it works:
Admin creates an election with candidates and time limits
Users connect their wallet and register to vote
Voting is restricted to one vote per election per wallet address
Results are displayed live with vote counts and percentages
Blockchain ensures votes cannot be changed or deleted
Technology Stack:
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
Blockchain Simulation: Mock Web3 service (ready for real Ethereum integration)
Smart Contract: Complete Solidity contract included with security features
Styling: Dark crypto theme with gradients and glow effects

What's Included:
Full React components for all voting functionality
Production-ready Solidity smart contract with gas optimization
Deployment guide for Ganache, Truffle/Hardhat, and Ethereum testnets
Complete project structure and documentation
Mock data for testing without real blockchain setup
The system is currently using simulated blockchain interactions but includes everything needed to connect to real Ethereum networks.
